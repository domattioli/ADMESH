# Porting notes

Running log of MATLAB → Python substitutions and behavior differences
encountered during the port. One entry per decision; newest at top.

Template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <stage> — <title>

**MATLAB**: `function(args)` in `<path>.m`
**Python**: `admesh.<module>.function(args)`
**Substitution**: <what was replaced>
**Behavior diff**: <closed-vs-open boundary, tie-break, ordering, etc.>
**Impact**: <how tests / callers are affected>
```
