# CLAUDE.md

Operational reference for Claude Code sessions on ADMESH.

**Read these three at every session start (in order):**
`CONSTITUTION.md` → `PROJECT_PLAN.md` → `CLAUDE.md`.

If CLAUDE.md contradicts the constitution, the constitution wins.

## Project overview

Python port of `01_ADMESH_Library` from
[`domattioli/QuADMesh-MATLAB`](https://github.com/domattioli/QuADMesh-MATLAB)
at commit `19b2eb9f078a648daec3fd40d5d4c6e072f467ac`. See
`CONSTITUTION.md` Article I for the north star; Article II for hard
rules (faithful port, no C extensions in first cut, 0-based indexing).

Local MATLAB reference clone: `/workspace/QuADMesh-MATLAB` (branch
`main`). Source tree of interest: `01_ADMESH_Library/`.

## MATLAB → Python conventions

**Naming**
- `CreateBackgroundGrid.m` → `create_background_grid()` in
  `admesh/background_grid.py`.
- Private helpers keep their MATLAB name in snake_case, leading
  underscore if they're module-private.

**Indexing**
- MATLAB 1-based → Python 0-based. Subtract 1 wherever the MATLAB
  source indexes into arrays.
- MATLAB `end` → Python `-1` or `len(x) - 1`.
- MATLAB `x(i:j)` inclusive → Python `x[i-1:j]` (half-open, remember
  the upper bound doesn't shift).

**Common substitutions**
| MATLAB | Python |
|---|---|
| `inpolygon(xq, yq, xv, yv)` | `admesh.in_polygon.in_polygon(xq, yq, xv, yv)` (our port) |
| `delaunay(x, y)` | `scipy.spatial.Delaunay(np.c_[x, y]).simplices` |
| `griddata` | `scipy.interpolate.griddata` |
| `bwdist` | `scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt` |
| `struct` | `dataclasses.dataclass` or dict — pick per-module |
| cell array of varying-length vectors | `list[np.ndarray]` |

Document each non-obvious substitution in `docs/PORTING_NOTES.md` with
a one-line note on any behavior difference (closed-vs-open boundary,
tie-breaking, ordering).

**Docstring template**
```python
def create_background_grid(domain, params):
    """Build a structured background grid over the domain.

    Port of ``01_ADMESH_Library/02_Create_Background_Grid/CreateBackgroundGrid.m``
    from QuADMesh-MATLAB @ 19b2eb9.

    Parameters
    ----------
    domain : ...
    params : ...

    Returns
    -------
    grid : ...
    """
```

## Numba conventions

`admesh/mesh_size.py` hosts the iterative PDE solver ported from
`MeshSizeIterativeSolver.c`. Keep two implementations in-module:

1. `_solve_iter_py(...)` — pure NumPy, readable, the reference.
2. `_solve_iter_nb(...)` — `@njit(cache=True)`, optimized.

A test in `tests/test_mesh_size.py` asserts they agree to `atol=1e-10`
on a fixed input. The public `solve_iter(...)` dispatches to the Numba
path by default, with a `use_numba=False` kwarg for debugging.

---

## Testing

- One test file per stage: `tests/test_<stage>.py`.
- Fixtures: `.npz` under `tests/fixtures/<stage>/<case>.npz` with
  named arrays for inputs and expected outputs.
- Load pattern:
  ```python
  data = np.load("tests/fixtures/distance/square.npz")
  out = admesh.distance.signed_distance(data["x"], data["y"], data["poly"])
  np.testing.assert_allclose(out, data["expected"], atol=1e-8)
  ```
- Keep fixtures small (< 1 MB per file ideally) so the repo stays
  lightweight.

---

## Session cadence (lightweight)

Each working session:
1. **Orient** — read `CONSTITUTION.md`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, this file.
2. **Pick a stage** from the current phase in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.
3. **Port** the MATLAB source, committing per file/function.
4. **Test** against fixtures; iterate until green.
5. **Commit + push.** Update `PROJECT_PLAN.md` "Where we are today" if
   a phase milestone landed.

No mandatory session reports, no 4-agent planning, no dispatch queue —
this is a port, not a research project. Keep it simple.

---

## Branching (operational)

See **Constitution Article VI rules 5–8** for the binding rules. Quick
operational summary:

- **Default to `main`.** Don't create branches for one-off edits.
- **Speckit is the only branch-creator.** New feature branches come
  from `/speckit-specify` (which fires the `before_specify` git hook).
  Don't run `git checkout -b` directly.
- **Speckit naming only.** Branches follow `NNN-<short-name>`
  (sequential) per `.specify/init-options.json`. Do not create or
  accept `claude/<feature>-<hash>` branches; if the session-system
  pre-creates one, ignore or consolidate under the speckit branch.
- **Scan first.** Before invoking `/speckit-specify`, run
  `git branch -a` and look for a branch already covering the same
  feature (by short-name, keywords, or related issue #). Reuse it
  rather than create a parallel one.
- **Consolidate redundancies.** If you find duplicate branches for the
  same feature, ask the user once, then delete the redundant ones
  (local + remote) and keep only the speckit-named branch.

<!-- SPECKIT START -->
**No active spec-kit feature.**

The most recent feature, `005-adcirc-mesh-registry`, was developed
inside this repo between 2026-04-25 and 2026-04-26, then **migrated
out** to its own repository: [`domattioli/ADMESH-Domains`](https://github.com/domattioli/ADMESH-Domains).
That repo is now the sole home of the registry; do not reintroduce
`mesh_registry/` or `admesh_domains/` code into this repo.

The historical specification artifacts remain at
`specs/005-adcirc-mesh-registry/` for reference, with `MIGRATED.md`
documenting the extraction. New design work for the registry should
happen in the ADMESH-Domains repo.

Prior feature (`001-pythonize-and-fort14-integration`) shipped; its
artifacts remain under `specs/001-pythonize-and-fort14-integration/`
for reference. Constitution Principle I continues to govern the 13
faithful-port stage modules in `admesh/*.py` — they MUST stay
numerically identical to the QuADMesh-MATLAB reference.
